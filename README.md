# Spam-base (Spam/noSpam) Classification
**Data Analysis** project focused on studying statistically the Spam-base dataset (collection of information about Spam or no-Spam emails) in order to achieve the best binary classification algorithm with the highest performance. 

The project includes different phases that are the following:
- **Data Acquisition**.
- **Data Cleaning and Organization** with outliers and inconsistencies analysis, dataset balancing.
- **Statistical exploration** using Probability mass function, Cumulative Distribution Function, Gaussian Fitting, Variability Analysis (IQR) and Variables correlation.
- **Classification** with different algorithms with performance valutation (Logistic Regression with Backward Elimination, Decision Trees and Forest, K-NN).
- **Clustering**: K-MEANS.


<b>Dataset informations: </b> 
- <b>Number of instances</b>: **4601** in which **1813** are SPAM (39.4%)
- <b>Number of attributes</b>: 58 (57 continues, 1 categorial (class label).

The last column of the data matrix represents the label related to the belonging class (1: spam, 0:no-spam). 
Many of the attributes indicate how frequently a particular word or character appears in the email text.
